Que1: What are the benefits of including roles in the programmes?
Ans: 

Que2: When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
Ans: When it is called.

Que3: What statement causes a feature to be created?
Ans: 

Que4: What is the distinction between a function and a call to a function?
Ans: Function: A function, in any programming language, is simply a reference to the 
               block of code in computer's memory.
     Function call: A call to the function means we want the interpreter to run the code at
                    which the called function was referring to.


Que5: In a Python application, how many global scopes are there? 
      How many local scopes are there?

Ans:In Python, there is only one global scope or module scope for every program you run. This scope exists
    until you terminate the program.
    For Local scopes, they reside inside the gloabl scopes, and you can create as many local
    scopes you want in the global scope or the module scope.


Que6: When a function call returns, what happens to variables in the local scope?
Ans: When we call the function, a local name space for that function is created, and in that name
     space, we have all the variables which were inside the function. The variables which were 
     local to that function are assigned the values in that name space.

Que7: What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
Ans: The return value is the value which is returned by an expression in the console. Yes, the expression has the return value.

Que8: What is the return value of a call to a function that does not have a return statement?
Ans:  None

Que9: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
Ans: Method1: A varibale inside a function refers to the global variable if it is not assigned any value inside that function.
              For e.g.

              a = 10 # global varibale

              def func():
                 print(a) #Here a refers to the global variable a
              
              func()  ==> 10
             -------------------------------------------------------------------    
    Method2: By using the global keyword
              
              a = 10
              def func1():
                 global a
                 a = 5 # Here, a refers to the global variable
              
              print(a)  ==> 10
              -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Method3:   By assigning a global variable to local variable
              
              a = 10
              def func2():
                 x = a
                 print(x) # Here x is the local variable, but it refers to the global variable a.
                       # Thus, when we change a, x also changes.
              func2()  ==> 10
              
              a = 5
              func2()  ==> 5



Que10: What data form does None belong to?
Ans: None is the object of the class NoneType. Thus, None belongs to the data form NoneType


Que11: What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
