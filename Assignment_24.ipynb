    "### Ans: Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to declare functions in python. The def statement tell the python interpreter that it is a function declaration with the function name written after def keyword and the function body as the indented portion of code, whereas the lambda keyword in lambda expressions tell python interpreter that anything written after the lambda keyword in the same line is the body part of the same lambda expression.\n",
    "### Both types of functions work in the similar way, i.e. they execute their body content only when they are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Although similar in functionality, there are some differences. These are:\n",
    "1. The def keyword is used to create function object and bind it to a name, where as the lambda expression returns a function object with no name, therefore lambda functions are also called anonymous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The functions made with def keyword, once executed, doesn't return anything until called, whereas the lambda expression returns the function object when it is executed without even being being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The functions made with def keyword can be very complex and contains a separate return statement in its body to return some value, whereas the lambda function can only have a single line expression in it body, which evaluates to its return value"

   ]

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Ans: Some design guidelines for writing coding functions in python are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Indentation:** It is also known as 4 space rule. It helps to know which code belongs to which function. The function body is always indented by 1 level w.r.t. the function declaration statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naming Conventions:** According to PEP8, it is a good practice to choose the name for the function which makes some sense w.r.t. the context. As a function name, you have it as:\n",
    "    * Of 1 letter, but it should be in lower case\n",
    "    * Of multiple letters, but all in smaller case\n",
    "    * Can consists of letters (in lower case) and digits, but shouldn't start with a digit.\n",
    "    * Can contain any number of words (all in lower case) separated by underscores\n",
    "    * Can start with 1 or more underscores\n",
    "    * Can contain any number of underscores in-between words.\n",
    "    * Shouldn't be a keyword.\n",
    "    * For a function name with single character, the name shouldn't be an identifier which may lead to confusion, for e.g. letter O and zero (0) or lowercase L (l) and upper case i (I) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document String:** Also known as doc strings. This doc string is very important in any function as it helps users to understand the functionality of that function and how to use that function. Rules for writing doc strings are:\n",
    "    * Firstly the quotation used for documenting a block of code is done in triple quotes\n",
    "    * You can also use single quote or double quotes if the doc string is of just one line, however, if multiple strings in single/double quotes are written one after another, then only the first string will be considered as the doc string, and rest are ignored.\n",
    "    * Doc strings are always written at the beginning of the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We have to use UTF-8 or ASCII encoding for python coding in general as it is the default encoding which is meant for international environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When writing the parameters, you should have a habit of giving 1 space after each comma, not before a comma. Also, you should give 1 space around the operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It is better if you provide function annotations. This improves  the user experience a lot."
