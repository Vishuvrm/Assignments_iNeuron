    "# Que1: What are the benefits of including roles in the programmes?\n",
    "# Ans: It reduces the burden on the signle person by distributing the different programming\n",
    "#      tasks to different individuals, like Exception handling part on one person, file handling \n",
    "#      on another, logic buiding part on another, database part to anothe, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que2: When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "# Ans: When it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que3: What statement causes a feature to be created?\n",
    "# Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "# Que4: What is the distinction between a function and a call to a function?\n",
    "# Ans: Function: A function, in any programming language, is simply a reference to the \n",
    "#                block of code in computer's memory.\n",
    "#      Function call: A call to the function means we want the interpreter to run the code at\n",
    "#                     which the called function was referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que5: In a Python application, how many global scopes are there? \n",
    "#       How many local scopes are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:In Python, there is only one global scope or module scope for every program you run. This scope exists\n",
    "#     until you terminate the program.\n",
    "#     For Local scopes, they reside inside the gloabl scopes, and you can create as many local\n",
    "#     scopes you want in the global scope or the module scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que6: When a function call returns, what happens to variables in the local scope?\n",
    "# Ans: When we call the function, a local name space for that function is created, and in that name\n",
    "#      space, we have all the variables which were inside the function. The variables which were \n",
    "#      local to that function are assigned the values in that name space.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que7: What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "# Ans: The return value is the value which is returned by an expression in the console. Yes, the expression has the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que8: What is the return value of a call to a function that does not have a return statement?\n",
    "# Ans:  None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Que9: How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "# Ans: Method1: A varibale inside a function refers to the global variable if it is not assigned any value inside that function.\n",
    "#               For e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "#               a = 10 # global varibale\n",

    "# Que11: What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "# Ans: When the python runs the statement: import areallyourpetsnamederic, then various things happen.\n",
    "#      1) First of all the python will check the sys.modules cache to see if module is already imported. If yes, it will use the same reference for that module in the\n",
    "#         current running environment, as was there in sys.modules cache. If no, then it will have to load the module.\n",
    "#      2) The python loads the module via following steps:\n",
    "#         step a) Search for the module areallyourpetsnamederic in paths mentioned in sys.path.  If module is not present in any path, it will show ModuleNotFound error, otherwise\n",
    "#                 step b will happen.\n",
    "#         step b) If python doesn't find the module in sys.path, then it will first create a module object (type.ModuleType).\n",
    "#         step c) Then it will load the complete source code from the module file in the memory.\n",
    "#         step d) Then it adds an entry to sys.modules cache and globals() cache with name as module name (areallyourpetsnamederic) and key as the reference to the module object created.\n",
    "#         sted e) Then it compiles and executes the source code.\n",
    "#       NOTE: If the module is imported for the 1st time, then python actually compiles and executes the code in module.\n",
    "#             However, if it is imported more than 1 time, then it will not reload the module. It will simply use the reference in the sys.modules or globals() cache.\n",

    "# Que12: If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "# Ans: After importing the spam module, we would call bacon() as method, and we would call it as:\n",
    "#      spam.bacon()\n",

    "# Que13: What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "# Ans: To save a program from crashing due to an error, we shoud do exception handling, so that\n",
    "#     if anytime an error occur, the program can handle that error wothout crashing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Que14: What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "# Ans: In try clause, we generally write that part of the code where we expect some run-time exception. If no exception is found in the code present in try block, the program \n",
    "#      runs as if there were no try block present, but if any exception occurs in the code in the try block, then instead of directly throwing the error in the console,\n",
    "#      the try block detect that error, and stops running the furthur code in the try clause and the control goes to the except clause, where the error in the try clause is handled.\n"
