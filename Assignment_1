Que1. What are the differences between operators and values in the following?
Ans:  * => This is the multiplication operator and is used for multiplying the 2 objects
      "hello" => This is a string value
      -87.8 => This is the integer value
      - => This is a subtraction operator, and is used for subtracting one object from another.
      / => This is a division operator, and is used for dividing 2 objects
      + => This is addition operator
      6 => This is an integer value

Que2. What is the difference between string and variables?
Ans: String => A string is a data type in python
     variable => A variable is a reference to the object's memory address
     
     spam => It's a variable
     "spam" => It's a string object
 

Que3. Describe 3 different data forms.
Ans: The 3 main data forms in python are:
      1. Numeric
      2. Bollean
      3. String
 
Que4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?
Ans: An Expression is made up of 3 components:
     1. Operators
     2. Literals
     3. Identifiers
     An expression simply represents some entity like an integer, a string, or any instance of a class.
     An expression may also contain some operations between entities. For example.
     If "hello" is an expression, then ("hello" + " world") is also an expression.
     
Que5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. What's the
difference between a declaration and an expression?
Ans: Declaration: Declaring a variable simply means binding it to a datatype. It simple terms, creating a
                  space inside the memory to store some values. In python, the variables are automatically
                  declared when we write the assignment statement. For e.g. in our case
                  spam = 10    automatically declares an integer variable named spam
     Expression: An expression is a combination of variables, operations, and values which results 
                in some some final value. For example 2+2 is an expression which yields an integer object 2.
 
 
Que6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
      bacon = 22
      bacon + 1

Ans: The bacon still contains 22

Que7. What should be the values of the following 2 terms be?
      1. 'spam'+'spamspam'
      2. 'spam'*3

Ans:  For 1.,   it is 'spamspamspam'
      For 2.,   it is 'spamspamspam'

Que8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 not?
Ans: eggs satisfies all the rules of being an identifier, thus it is fit to be a variable name, while
     100 is an integer object, and a variable name can't be a numerical value or start with a numerical value.
     Thus, egg is a true variable name, but  is not.

Que9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a
      floating-point number, or a string?
Ans: Value to an integer: int function
     Value to floating-point numer: float function
     Value to a string: str function


Que10. 10. What is the error caused by this expression? What would you do about it?

'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'

Ans: It gives the following error:
      TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
     
     Rectified expression would be like:  'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos.'
