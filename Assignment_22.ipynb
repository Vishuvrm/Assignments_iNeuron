    "        2. Then we define a function called nested. In this function we did following:\n",
    "            a. First, we write a nonlocal variable refrencing statement => nonlocal X  => This statement means that X inside the body of nested function will refer to the variable X inside the nonlocal scope, i.e. X inside the local scope of function func. Thus X has value \"NI\"\n",
    "            b. The next stament is the assignment statement which assigns a new value to the nonlocal variable X: X = \"Spam\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. Then we call the nested function insode the local scope of func.\n",
    "        4. Finally we print the value of X inside the localscope of func.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now, when we call the function func(), the following things happen:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. A vriable called X is created and it holds the value \"NI\"\n",
    "        2. A function named nested is defined inside the local scope of func.\n",
    "        3. The nested() function is called, and following things happen inside nested function:\n",
    "            a. nonlocal X:  This statement is executed and it tells the python interpreter that X inside this function is nothing but the X from the nonlocal scope, i.e. scope of function func.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            b. Now, this X is assigned a new value \"Spam\"\n",

    "        4. Now, a print statement is executed: print(X) \n",
    "           As we know that in step 3, the value of X is changed to \"Spam\", thus it will print the following to the console:\n",
