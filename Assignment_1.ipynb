    "# Que1. What are the differences between operators and values in the following?\n",
    "# Ans:  * => This is the multiplication operator and is used for multiplying the 2 objects\n",
    "#       \"hello\" => This is a string value\n",
    "#       -87.8 => This is the integer value\n",
    "#       - => This is a subtraction operator, and is used for subtracting one object from another.\n",

    "# Ans: eggs satisfies all the rules of being an identifier, thus it is fit to be a variable name, while\n",
    "#      100 is an integer object, and a variable name can't be a numerical value or start with a numerical value.\n",
